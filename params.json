{"name":"Knockout Meteor","body":"Creates Knockout Observables based on queries against Meteor Collections. When the results of those queries change, Knockout Meteor will ensure that the associated Observables are updated.\r\n\r\n## Why? ##\r\n\r\n[Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com) lets you create complex associations between Javascript model data and DOM elements using an expressive and declarative binding syntax. The Knockout Mapping plugin excels at atomically updating your Javascript models (and hence your UI) based on incoming data, updating only that which has changed. These are two strengths that Meteor does not currently possess.\r\n\r\n[Meteor](http://meteor.com), however, makes it incredibly easy to ferry model data back and forth between a server and its connected clients. Knockout Meteor acts as a bridge between these two frameworks. It lets you construct queries against Meteor Collections that behave like Knockout Observables that update themselves atomically and automatically when the results of those queries change.\r\n\r\n## Usage ##\r\n\r\nLet's assume there exists a `Meteor.Collection` called `Todos`, and that our view model wants to track unfinished todos, finished todos, and the oldest unfinished todo.\r\n\r\n    var Todos = new Meteor.Collection(\"todos\");\r\n\r\n### In the view model: ###\r\n\r\nUse `ko.meteor.find()` and `ko.meteor.findOne()` like you would normally use `ko.observableArray()` and `ko.observable()`:\r\n\r\n    var viewModel = {\r\n      unfinishedTodos: ko.meteor.find(Todos, {done: false}),\r\n      finishedTodos: ko.meteor.find(Todos, {done: true}),\r\n      oldestUnfinishedTodo: ko.meteor.findOne(Todos, {done: true}, {meteor_options: {sort: {created_at:1}}})\r\n    };\r\n    Meteor.startup( function() { ko.applyBindings(viewModel); } );\r\n\r\n### In the HTML: ###\r\n\r\nSince `ko.meteor.find()` and `ko.meteor.findOne()` return instances of `ko.observableArray` and `ko.observable` respectively, you can bind to them in the way you're used to:\r\n\r\n    <ul data-bind=\"foreach: unfinishedTodos\">\r\n      <li data-bind=\"text: title\"></li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\nAny update to the Meteor `Todos` collection will now trigger a UI refresh. This includes local updates, and updates pushed from the server.\r\n\r\n## Documentation ##\r\n\r\n`ko.meteor.find()` and `ko.meteor.findOne()` share the same method signature.\r\n\r\n    ko.meteor.find( collection, selector[, options] )\r\n    ko.meteor.findOne( collection, selector[, options] )\r\n\r\n### The `collection` argument ###\r\n\r\nMust be an instance of a `Meteor.Collection`\r\n\r\n### The `selector` argument ###\r\n\r\nA Mongo selector, or String. See the Meteor documentation on [`find()`](http://docs.meteor.com/#find) or [`findOne()`](http://docs.meteor.com/#findone) for more information.\r\n\r\n### The `options` argument ###\r\n\r\nAn optional Object. Recognizes the following keys:\r\n\r\n* `view_model` – an object constructor.\r\n\r\n> The mapper will instantiate an object using this constructor, then map each record in the Meteor Collection to the resulting instance.\r\n\r\n* `meteor_options` – additional configuration for `Meteor.Collection.find()` or `Meteor.Collection.findOne()`.\r\n\r\n> See the Meteor documentation on the `options` argument of [`find()`](http://docs.meteor.com/#find) and [`findOne()`](http://docs.meteor.com/#findone) for more information.\r\n \r\n* `mapping` – additional configuration for the Knockout Mapping plugin.\r\n\r\n> See the \"[Advanced Usage](http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/plugins-mapping.html#advanced_usage)\" section of the Knockout Mapping documentation for more information.\r\n\r\n## Requirements ##\r\n\r\n* Meteor *(>= 0.3.5)* – https://github.com/meteor/meteor\r\n* knockout.js *(>= 2.1.0rc2)* – https://github.com/SteveSanderson/knockout\r\n* knockout.mapping.js *(>= 2.1.2)* - https://github.com/SteveSanderson/knockout.mapping\r\n\r\n## Developing ##\r\n\r\nWant to contribute? Great! To hack away you'll want a clone of this repo, and the Coffeescript compiler.\r\n\r\n    > git clone https://github.com/steveluscher/knockout.meteor.git\r\n    > cd knockout.meteor\r\n    > npm install\r\n\r\n`make compile` will compile the Coffeescript file in `./src` into Javascript files located in `./build` and `./example/client`. Use `make watch` if you would like the compiler to run every time you save.\r\n\r\n## Giving thanks ##\r\n\r\nWeb development pays bills, but my real passion is music.
